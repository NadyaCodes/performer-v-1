# Welcome to Act. Sing. Dance. Repeat. - The Code

Act. Sing. Dance. Repeat. is a resource for young Canadian actors singers and dancers.

The primary service is a Program Directory and a Program Finder where students can filter our listings of training programs based on what they're looking for. From there, they can save their favorites to their own personal profile. Patreon subscribers can also add notes to their programs and add custom programs to their page.

There is also a blog, merch, and hopefully there will be more to come!
