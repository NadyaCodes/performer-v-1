const tsIdentityBody = `#H2#Who am I? \nWhen you're at theatre school, your identity and “type” is constantly scrutinized. This isn't always a BAD thing. Theatre school is a fantastic time to focus on finding your identity because you will never find a more sheltered environment to play with such a variety of styles. The complexity is more because the student/teacher dynamic traditionally favours the teacher as the authority. An artist's identity is more personal, however, and examining facts and trends isn't necessarily the best way to find it. While it’s certainly worth experimenting with whatever your faculty members recommend, your opinion matters too. A LOT. Theatre school may be the perfect place to play with your identity, but finding it might take a little more soul searching than just doing what you're told. \nI know you might be saying, “I just want to work, and if these professionals know what I need to do to get a job, that’s clearly what I need to do”. Blindly following recommendations will only get you so far, though. You may not have a solid identity when you enter theatre school, but you certainly know more about yourself than your teachers do. They weren't raised in the same environment, nor can they hear your innermost thoughts and opinions. Their suggestions are worth exploring, but don’t automatically adopt them without question. They are only right if they feel right for you.\n#H3#A faculty member’s recommendations are coming from a place of objectivity and human bias. Teachers don't have omnipotent wisdom. Only you can be the ultimate authority when it comes to your identity. \nEssentially, a teacher's job is to use their expertise to recommend what they would do in your situation. I will repeat that: they are using their expertise to RECOMMEND what THEY would do in your situation. A recommendation is not a solid fact that leads to greatness. They are also not you and they are making these recommendations based on their experience, not yours. Their job is to help you discover your inner artist, not dictate your only path to success.\n#H3#They are the industry professional, but you are the YOU professional.\nIt is your career, and it is imperative that whatever direction you go in is comfortable and inspiring for YOU. \nHOWEVER...\n#H2#What if they don't understand me? Is my theatre school experience a waste? \nIf there is a discrepancy between how your mentors see you and how you see yourself, don’t automatically throw out everything they say. Use that knowledge to figure out WHY they thought those things. You can still progress towards finding your identity in a theatre school that doesn't understand you. \nIf they have misconceptions about you, it means that you're likely giving off  unclear signals. These could be a blend of your skillset, physical attributes and personality. Either that, or they’re just stuck in the industry’s traditional bias rut that we’re all hopefully trying to move beyond. \nThe best thing for you to do is pinpoint what these signals are so you can understand them. Once you see them, you'll be able to do something about them, whether that means changing your habits or simply voicing your concerns. Your faculty aren't the only people who'll assume these things about you. These impressions will become recurring themes until you address them. \n#H2#My theatre school misunderstood my identity and here's what it looked like for me: \nMy work ethic as always been a key component of my identity. Though you may think you can't go wrong with a good work ethic, I only recently realized how much of an impact it had on my theatre school experience. \nSomewhere along the line in my academic life, I learned that the harder I worked at something, the sooner it would go away. While this is logical, I've learned that it sends complicated signals since it's not what people normally do. When someone works hard at something, one assumes they enjoy it (or struggles with it...but that wasn't the case here). So, while my brain said, “I'll work really hard on this so that it will go away sooner and we can move on to the stuff I really want to do”, my teachers saw, “wow, she’s working really hard at this, she must really enjoy it…I’ll give her more of THAT”. \nI totally could've gotten more out of the experience if I spoke to someone with words instead of working harder at home every night. Imagine how different that experience would've been if I had spent those years working on things that inspired me and pushed me in a direction I wanted to go! \n#H2#Sooo...how can my theatre school help me find my identity? \nIt’s always worth taking a mentor’s suggestions. You might turn out to have a surprise affinity for something new! It’s also totally fine if you try it and realize it’s not for you, though...EVEN IF YOU’RE GOOD AT IT. Not everyone enjoys the things they're naturally good at. Though you can achieve a certain standard with strictly talent, skill and hard work, chances are you'll fizzle out without a passionate drive. There’s a certain calibre that can only happen when an artist loves what they do. Other people will have the skillset AND the love behind it, and those are the ones who will flourish. \nIf your faculty has an idea, try it out wholeheartedly, even if it seems outlandish. You won't know what it feels like if you don't legitimately try. If it's not a good fit, your next step is to figure out why you were perceived to be that way in the first place. If one person thought you fit into a certain box, chances are, other people will think that, too. Once you understand why, you'll be able to steer things in a more suitable direction. \nIf you're on a long, frustrating search to find your identity as a performer, know that it’s all a part of the process. Sometimes the only way to discover what works is to rule out a bunch of things that don’t. All this means is you will appreciate home that much more once you find it! \n####\nIf you're LOOKING for a theatre school in Canada, you came to the right place!

const tryingHardBody = `Wouldn’t it be glorious if one day, theatre school was nothing more than a training platform for artistry and healthy growth? The truth is, many theatrical hopes and dreams die before students even enter the industry. Yes, they may enter the world and struggle for a bit first before they give up, but that doesn’t make post-secondary training completely innocent in the death of those dreams. Theatre teachers are a key component in keeping this inspiration alive.\nA theatre teacher’s job is to help their student’s flame of inspiration become a bonfire. That delicate flame can, however, quickly dim in an unhealthy student-teacher situation.\nAs a former tutor, I have first-hand experience watching some of these flames dim…for absolutely no valid reason whatsoever. While it may seem like a tactic that can encourage a re-invigoration of work ethic, it’s a dangerous message in such a stressful and powerless environment.\n#H2#Theatre teachers, listen up: please think twice before ever telling a student they aren’t trying hard enough.\nWhen you’re a postsecondary student in a performance-based program, you’re trying. The degree of “trying” might be different for different students (they can’t try 10000000% at every aspect of their lives simultaneously), but all students should be assumed to be trying by default.\nStudents have fought and won an entire battle before they even stepped foot in your class.\n#UL#Each one of them:#LI#Trained tirelessly and became inspired by the discipline. #LI#Spent countless hours researching institution possibilities.#LI#Worked hard to accomplish the application requirements.#LI#Paid to be considered for multiple programs.#LI#Fought to be noticed in the pile of submissions.#LI#Completed scholarship applications and worked side jobs to pay tuition.#LI#Left behind the only security blanket they’ve ever known.\nTo assume they’re “not trying hard enough” every time they come up short by your standards is insulting. All it will do is discourage them from trying harder and will ultimately limit their potential. No matter how hard they were working before, the moment their efforts become futile and unappreciated, they will give up.\n#H2#They did care. But now, they don’t.\nThe next time you assume someone isn’t working hard enough, it may be time to re-evaluate the way you perceive progress. Your students are operating with a different body, with different experiences, with different life views, and with different tastes than you. How can you possibly expect to fully understand how hard your students are working at any moment?\n#H2#Before EVER questioning work ethic, I’m begging theatre teachers to please consider the following:\n####\n#H2#Are there physical reasons why they do things differently?\nNot everybody is built with the physical traits to do everything. But guess what: they can do other things you can’t do because of it. This is part of the beauty of physical art forms – different bodies can do different things. Are there perhaps physical differences between you and your student that could mean they are struggling for reasons other than “not trying hard enough”?\n#H2#Does your student have different life experiences?\nThe answer to this will always be yes, yes, and more yes. There is no way you can fully understand them, and because of this, safe communication should be of utmost importance. They will be bringing their own life experiences to their art, and it is more than imperative for you to be mindful and sensitive to that. Learn how to be respectful and be open to learning yourself. There is no way for them to flourish in a place where they feel undervalued and misunderstood.\n#H2#Did you remember that your students are human?\nIf a student is struggling with their mental wellbeing, they might be trying as hard as they physically can. It’s entirely possibly they’re already working way too far over capacity and what you should actually be doing is encouraging them to slow down. School is challenging enough when your physical self isn’t being graded. Shouldn’t there be a certain level of forgiveness and accommodation for situations that could lead to bad life-habits and self-harm?\n#H2#Do they have different tastes than you?\nArt is art. Not everyone’s going to like what you like. As a teacher, your job is to help your students perform things safely and help them develop their own artistry. It may make sense to teach them how to control certain stylistic things (so they have a choice to use it or not), but not to the point of extreme perfection all the time. If something is a safety concern, it can certainly be something to worry about, but style is style, and uniqueness should be encouraged.\n#H2#Is the student trying to fit in with their peers?\nSometimes students will hinder their own progress because of their group of friends. It’s important to give students a little bit of slack, though: friendships will help carry them through school and life. If there is a true concern over their health because of these friendships, there can be a legitimate concern, but otherwise, let them find themselves. Make your class so interesting that they can’t HELP but pay attention.\n#H2#Are you teaching something they struggle with?\nJust because someone isn’t doing “well” at something, it doesn’t mean they aren’t trying. The student most likely knows they are struggling – you don’t need to remind them about it. Encourage them to keep trying and actively seek out new ways of helping them. Just because your process of 20+ years has worked for countless students does not mean it is the only process that CAN work. Perhaps by making an effort to help this student find success, you’ll make new discoveries in your own process.\n#H2#Are they bored?\nA little collaboration could be worthwhile here. If a student is bored, perhaps you can work with them to find ways they can add value to the class itself. Maybe they can teach something to you, too! Students like feeling respected and valued, and might even come to enjoy an “easy” class if they are, in turn, appreciated. As long as they are able to fulfil the requirements of the course, there’s also nothing wrong with giving them the freedom to use that class time to work on their own independent project. Trust them. If they find something interesting, they’re going to do it.\n####\n#H2#It’s true – theatre teachers are humans, too, and can’t be perfect all the time.\nTheatre teachers are burdened by their own biases and insecurities, but that doesn’t give them an excuse to pass those along to the next generation. The school system itself adds tons of extra unnecessary protocol layers that tend to limit a truly artistic environment, too. \nBut please, don’t kill a student’s passion by accusing them of not caring. Whether they did care or didn’t care, all you will do is dull their flame. \n#H2#Once one flame goes out, the rest need less encouragement to follow suit.`;
